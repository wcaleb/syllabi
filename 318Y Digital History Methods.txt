# Course Description

This hands-on, project-based course introduces students to the use of
digital tools and sources to conduct original historical research,
analyze or interpret findings, and communicate results.

In order to focus our efforts, we will apply what we learn to a
particular area of historical study: the history of nineteenth-century
runaway slave advertisements and slavery in Texas. Working in partial
collaboration with each other and with students in a similar, concurrent
course at the University of North Texas, students also produce a final,
open-web project that illustrates the promise and limits of digital
methods to the study of the pre-digital past.

## Course Objectives

Students in this course will:

1.  Gain an introductory technical knowledge of many digital tools or
    methods that can be useful to historians (such as dynamic mapping,
    social network analysis, topic modeling, and HTML publishing) and an
    in-depth knowledge of one or two.
2.  Read existing scholarship on a contested historical subject and
    formulate historiographical questions of their own.
3.  Learn to apply technical knowledge about digital history tools to a
    substantive and complex historical question about the history of
    slavery.
4.  Help to make a public-facing digital project that illustrates the
    promise and/or limitations of digital history methods.
5.  Acquire experience managing a team-based digital humanities project.
6.  Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different examples of
    digital scholarship, including work produced in the class.

## What to Expect

This course may feel different from your usual courses in several
respects. First, rather than simply learning course content, you will be
asked to apply your knowledge to make new things. Not all of these new
things will be determined on the first day of the course. Together with
a large responsibility for the final product(s) of this course, you will
have a large say in what we produce.

Second, to attain the technical skills necessary to make things, you may
sometimes be asked to inform and educate yourself outside of class,
using extracurricular resources. Be prepared for some DIY moments
throughout the semester.

You should also expect to have help, however; you won't be going it
alone as you learn new technical and analytical skills. You will be
working not just as an individual, but as a member of a team. Your
classmates are not your competitors, but your collaborators. In that
role they will sometimes be asked to help you figure out
assignment-related problems, evaluate your work, and share workloads. As
their collaborator, you should do the same in return.

Finally, much of your work for this course will be done "in public" on
our course blog or websites like Twitter; while your grades are always
private, some of your work will be shared with students elsewhere and
with the public at large. At particular points in the semester we will
be sharing results with a similar class being offered concurrently at
the University of North Texas.

All of these aspects of this course are actually not that new or rare at
Rice. In fact, all of them are characteristic of popular undergraduate
courses like [ENGI 120][] or [COMP 160][]. What may be unfamiliar to you
is doing these things in a humanities course, where our emphasis is
usually on individual and private reading, writing, and discussion. But
whether they are unfamiliar or not, these aspects of the class mean that
every student's engagement and participation will be essential to its
success. By the end you'll have sharpened your skills as an historian
while also acquiring digital, teamwork, and project management skills
that will be useful even beyond the study of history.

# Required Book

Most of our readings for the semester will be available online or in
OWL-Space. There is only one required book.

> John Hope Franklin and Loren Schweninger, *Runaway Slaves: Rebels on
> the Plantation*. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. ISBN:
> 978-0-19-508451-1

The book is available in the campus bookstore. Fondren Library also has
an electronic edition of the book if you would prefer to read it in your
browser.

# Schedule

## Semester Overview

In the first third of the semester, you will be introduced to some of
the general problems and benefits of digitizing primary sources, while
also learning about historiographical debates about runaway slave
advertisements and the history of slavery in Texas. By the end of this
phase of the class, we will have a growing set of digitized primary
sources, a list of historiographically significant questions that we can
ask about them, and an elementary knowledge of things like JSON, HTML
markup, Wordpress, and topic modeling.

In the second part of the class, which concludes around Spring Break,
you will work as part of a smaller group to become the class's resident
experts on a particular digital history method. After completing
tutorials about this method and examining cases of its use "in the
wild," you will present what you have learned to the class and also
propose your ideas about whether or how the method might help us answer
our historical questions about slavery and runaway ads.

The final third of the class is intentionally less finished than the
first two, because after your presentations, we will collectively make a
plan about how to spend the last weeks of the semester. This plan will
require us to create, by semester's end, a working prototype on the open
web that shows how a particular digital tool does (or does not) help us
to answer historical questions. Your responsibilities on this project
will be determined partly by me and partly by other members of the
class, who will also be asked to give me and you meaningful feedback
about your work for the project.

Spring Break

### Weeks 9 to 15

The schedule for this last third of the class will be determined based
on project planning decisions that we will make as a class in Week 9.
You will be assigned to work as part of a small group on some phase of
our final project. Progress Reports will be due from your group every
Monday beginning March 17 and continuing through April 14. A longer,
final report---whose objectives will be determined partly by the details
of our project---will be due by 5 p.m. on May 7. Further assignments and
deadlines will be posted on the course blog.

# Assignments

Details about your assignments will be distributed on the course blog
and tailored partly to the issues and questions that come up in class.
Below is a breakdown of what to expect. I will assign points to these
assignments when evaluating them; the total possible points are given in
parentheses.

## Homework (50 points)

As indicated above on the schedule, you will have five homework
assignments, each worth 10 points. Each homework assignment will have
both a technical and non-technical dimension, so that you will pick up
the habit of using digital tools and thinking programmatically while
also advancing our objectives as historians. Help will be provided for
the technical portions, but you also may have to locate your own
resources in order to complete the assignments. You will be allowed to
revise and resubmit one of the homeworks within 24 hours of the
deadline; the grade for the revised homework will replace the existing
grade for that homework.

## Presentation (15 points)

In Weeks 6 and 7, you will work with other classmates to complete some
tutorials on using a particular digital tool and will then give a
presentation to the class about that tool. I will assign the tool and
the tutorial, and details will be distributed in class.

## Progress Reports (50 points)

As also indicated above on the schedule, after Spring Break you will be
part of a smaller group assigned to complete part of our final project.
Your group must write five weekly progress reports about your work
together. Depending on the size of the group, some of the progress
reports may only be written by a subset of the group, with more
individual points given for the reports that you help to author; more
details about these reports will be distributed once groups and tasks
are set. Your group will be allowed to revise and resubmit one of the
progress reports within 24 hours of the deadline; the grade for the
revised homework will replace the existing grade for that homework.

## Team Participation (30 points)

Formal evaluation of your work on teams will be handled by me and a
program called [CATME][]. Three times during the semester, you will
complete a survey about your own team participation and that of other
members of the class. I will use these results, together with my own
observations of your participation, to assign you three scores (maximum
5 points each) for your teamwork. The final decision on grades always
remains with me, but I will also take into account how seriously your
responsibility to evaluate your classmates and yourself fairly.

## Final Report (30 points)

Your final report, details of which will be determined in part by our
class project, will be an essay that critically evaluates the prototype
that we have built in the last few weeks of the semester. Your essay
will assign and defend a "grade" of up to 30 points for our project,
explaining the reasoning behind your evaluation. I will, in turn, assign
a grade to your report of up to 30 points, based on how well you defend
and explain your assessment of the project. The final grade for this
assignment will be determined by averaging together my grade of your
report with your grade of the final project.

# Course Policies

#### Attendance

Because this class will require so much hands-on work, class attendance
is mandatory. Repeated absences will be detrimental to your grade for
team participation.

#### Late Assignments

To quote [*Highlander*][], "There can be only one." After that, late
work will not be accepted. Please contact me as soon as you know that an
assignment will be turned in late. Exceptions to this policy may (very
rarely) be made, but only when there are extenuating circumstances such
as a personal emergency or an illness requiring professional medical
attention. These circumstances must be documented to my satisfaction and
brought to my attention *before* the deadline for an assignment arrives.

#### Disability Services

If you have a documented disability that will impact your work in this
class, please contact one of the instructors during the first two weeks
of the semester to discuss accommodations confidentially. You will also
need to contact and register with the [Disability Support Services
Office][] in the Allen Center.

#### Academic Integrity

Plagiarism and intellectual dishonesty are violations of the Rice Honor
Code and will be reported to the Honor Council. [Plagiarism is defined
by the Honor Council][] as "quoting, paraphrasing, or otherwise using
another's words or ideas as one's own without properly crediting the
source. ... The Honor Council assumes that, unless otherwise credited,
all work submitted by the student is intended to be considered as his or
her own work. Any time a student draws particularly or generally from
another's work, the source should be properly credited."

Because there will be collaborative and technical work in this class,
there will be times when you are not only allowed but actively
*encouraged* to seek out help from other students and online resources.
Nonetheless, representing someone else's work as your own is never okay.
The guidelines for what you are allowed to do when collaborating will be
made very clear for each assignment, and you will always be required to
include acknowledgements of help you received.

## Final Grades

Your final grade will be calculated according to this table.

  Grade      Points Percent
  ------- --------- ---------
  A            161+ 92-100%
  A-        157-160 90-91%
  B+        154-157 88-89%
  B         145-153 83-87%
  B-        140-144 80-82%
  C+        135-139 77-79%
  C         128-134 73-76%
  C-        122-127 70-72%
  D+        117-121 67-69%
  D         110-116 63-66%
  D-        105-109 60-62%
  F           0-104 0-59%

**Important Note:** I reserve the right (but am under no obligation) to
raise a final grade if your work has shown marked improvement over the
course of the semester.
