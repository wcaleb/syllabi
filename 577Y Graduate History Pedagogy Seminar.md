# Course Description

This seminar is designed as an introduction to what will be an ongoing,
career-long process: learning how to teach history to undergraduate
students. Through class readings and discussion, we will focus primarily
on the process of identifying your objectives for a sample course of
your own design, and then planning a course and a set of assessments
around those goals. The seminar is also premised on the conviction that
one objective of any undergraduate history course should be to teach
"historical thinking," a non-obvious task that we will articulate with
the help of recent scholarship on teaching and learning history.

# Course Requirements

This is a 2-credit course for which you will receive a Satisfactory or
Unsatisfactory grade. The requirements for a Satisfactory grade are:

-   No more than one absence from class, except in cases of emergency.
-   Completion of all homework assignments listed on the schedule.
-   Submission of a complete final syllabus draft by December 5.
-   Observation of two class sessions from two *separate* undergraduate
    history courses offered at Rice this semester, with a written report
    of your experience emailed to the group before the next meeting of
    our seminar.

For the last requirement, we will divide up the schedule so that these
classroom observations are spaced throughout the semester. A list of
this semester's history courses is [available online][]. You should
contact instructors to ask about the observation beforehand.

**Note:** You are also *strongly* encouraged, but not required, to
attend at least one session of the [De Lange Conference][] on teaching being
held at Rice on October 13-14. [Online registration][] (free for Rice
students) closes on September 29, so be sure to act quickly.

# Recommended Resources

A one semester course cannot teach you everything there is to know about
teaching, or even cover all of the questions about good practice that
will arise in a teaching career. Part of your objective this semester
should be to identify a set of resources that you can return to
habitually in the future so that you can stay up-to-date on new ideas
and exchange tips with fellow teachers. Below are some resources that I
have found helpful, and I encourage you to check them out, too:

## Digital Media

I have found that Twitter can be a valuable resource for finding links
about teaching, particularly if you follow hashtags like
`#twitterstorians`, `#histedchat`, and `#historyteacher`. In addition, I
recommend these websites as good ones to subscribe to or bookmark:

-   ProfHacker, <http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/>
-   Hybrid Pedagogy, <http://www.hybridpedagogy.com>
-   Inside Higher Ed, <http://www.insidehighered.com>
-   Stanford History Education Group, <http://sheg.stanford.edu>
-   Tomorrow's Professor,

    <http://teachingunitedstateshistory.blogspot.com>
-   Teaching Carnival, <http://www.teachingcarnival.org>
-   The History Teacher, <http://www.thehistoryteacher.org>

You can also see my own frequently updated bookmarks on "teaching" on
[Pinboard][], and my syllabi and some posts on teaching at [my
website][].

## Books

There are no required books for this course; readings will be made
available electronically. But these books have influenced by own
approach to teaching, and I have included some chapters from them on the
schedule or under "recommended" readings:

-   Ken Bain, *What the Best College Teachers Do* (Cambridge, Mass.:
    Harvard University Press, 2004), ISBN 0-674-01325-5.

## Center for Teaching Excellence

Rice University's [Center for Teaching Excellence][] offers a variety of
resources and workshops throughout the year designed to promote
excellence in teaching. I encourage you to take full advantage of its
programming while you are at Rice.
