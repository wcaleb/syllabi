# Course Description

Americans are currently living through the sesquicentennial anniversary of the
Civil War, which resulted in the emancipation of 4 million enslaved people and
the deaths of approximately 720,000 Americans. In this course, we will explore
some of the major questions that historians ask about this era and learn how to
take well-informed, persuasive positions on scholarly debates. We will also
think about how the war should be remembered today, especially here at Rice
University.

## Learning Objectives

-   To identify the strengths and weaknesses of historical arguments about
    the Civil War era.

-   To take your own positions on debatable historical questions and
    support these positions with sound reasoning and evidence.

-   To communicate effectively by writing clear, well-supported position
    papers and participating in class debates.

-   To identify and think critically about the social, cultural, and
    political factors that influence the way the past is remembered.

## What to Expect

*Expect to attend class.* Active attendance in every class is
**mandatory** and crucial to your success in the course. Participation
in class discussions and debates forms a significant part of your final
grade.

*Do not expect* this course to be primarily a "blow by blow" history of
battles, events, and major figures in the Civil War. (If you would like
a detailed but accessible history of the War that amply covers the
military narrative, I suggest you consult James McPherson's *[Battle Cry
of Freedom][]*, which is widely available at bookstores.) We will read
and talk about military history, but we will also range far beyond the
battlefield.

*Expect to do a lot of reading and writing for this course.* You will be
writing four papers during this semester, and there will be weeks when
you have over 100 pages of historical scholarship to read. This load
will be unmanageable *unless* you set aside time outside of class every
day and start much earlier on assignments than you think you need to. We
will devote some class time to discussing how to manage the reading load
and how to write strong papers in a relatively short amount of time, but
keeping up with the reading and writing is primarily your
responsibility.

*Expect to succeed.* Our only reason for covering topics in class or
assigning reading outside of class will be to assist you in meeting the
learning objectives for the course. That means that if you apply
yourself to doing the work in this class, you can expect to learn. On
the other hand, if you decide you can't commit to doing all the work or
to attending class, then don't expect to learn what the course is
designed to teach.

## Required Books

There are four required books for this course, which you should purchase at the
beginning of the semester. All other readings will be made available to you
electronically on OWL-Space.

-   Chandra Manning, *What This Cruel War Was Over: Soldiers, Slavery,
    and the Civil War* (Vintage, paperback, 2008). ISBN: 978-0307277329,
    [Amazon][]
-   Eric Foner, *Nothing But Freedom: Emancipation and its Legacy*
    (Louisiana State University Press, paperback, new edition, 2007).
    ISBN: 978-0807132890, [Amazon][1]
-   Bruce Levine, *Confederate Emancipation: Southern Plans to Free and
    Arm Slaves during the Civil War* (Oxford, paperback, 2007). ISBN:
    978-0195315868, [Amazon][2]
-   Tony Horwitz, *Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the
    Unfinished Civil War* (Vintage, paperback, 1999). ISBN:
    978-0679758334, [Amazon][3]

# Assignments

#### Four Position Papers

In these four- to six-page double-spaced papers, you will defend your
position on four debatable historical questions about the Civil War era.
The prompt for each paper, along with specific guidelines and criteria
for grading, will be distributed at least one week before each is due.
Two of the prompts (the first and the third) will ask you to take
positions on issues we have discussed extensively in class. The other
two prompts (the second and the fourth) will ask you to apply reasoning
skills honed in class to a previously unconsidered issue or debate,
using a packet of additional scholarly articles distributed with the
prompt.

#### Pre-Discussion Reports

As noted below on the Schedule, approximately eight (8) sessions this
semester will be devoted to "Class Discussion" of assigned readings. On
each of these dates, you should submit a brief, informal "pre-discussion
report" by email to the professor and the TA. **The email must include
"HIST 246" somewhere in the subject line in order to be considered for
credit.**

The report should be put in the body of the email itself and should
consist of two fully-developed paragraphs. The first paragraph should
answer a question that will be emailed to you in advance, using specific
evidence and examples from the reading to support your answer. The
second paragraph can discuss anything about the reading; you could use
this part, for example, to talk about something that interested,
confused, or impressed you, or something that reminded you of other
topics in the class. Paragraph Two is up to you!

You can earn up to 5 points on each report, which are due *by 11:00 am*
on the day of the discussion. Late reports will not be accepted, but
your lowest report grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.

#### Class Participation

There will be ample opportunities to participate in class by making
comments during class discussions, participating in class debates, and
working with other students on in-class presentations. You should read
any assigned materials before class and be prepared to participate in
class discussions.

For each class meeting specifically marked as a "Class Discussion," the
teaching assistant will note your participation for assessment purposes,
and your participation grade will be based on these scores. I reserve
the right, but am under no obligation, to raise your participation grade
in cases where you have also been an active participant on other class
days.

At the midpoint of the semester, you will receive information about your
participation grade thus far, but you may ask about your participation
grade at any point during the semester.

#### Final Project

A final group project will relate to the way that the Civil War is
remembered locally at Rice University. This project will include an oral
presentation as well as a brief two- or three-page memo, but you group
will be responsible for dividing up which part of the project you work
on. More details forthcoming in class. 

# Grading Policies

Your final grade in the course will be determined as follows:

  Assignment                 100% 500 pts
  ------------------------ ------ ---------
  Paper \#1                   10% 50 pts
  Paper \#2                   20% 100 pts
  Paper \#3                   20% 100 pts
  Paper \#4                   20% 100 pts
  Class Participation          8% 40 pts
  Pre-Discussion Reports       7% 35 pts
  Final Project               15% 75 pts

The following key will determine your letter grade:

  Grade      Points Percent
  ------- --------- ---------
  A            460+ 92-100%
  A-        450-459 90-91%
  B+        440-449 88-89%
  B         415-439 83-87%
  B-        400-414 80-82%
  C+        385-399 77-79%
  C         365-384 73-76%
  C-        350-364 70-72%
  D+        335-349 67-69%
  D         315-334 63-66%
  D-        300-314 60-62%
  F           0-300 0-59%

If your performance shows significant improvement over the course of the
semester, I reserve the right (but assume no obligation) to raise your
final grade.

# General Policies

#### Late Work

Pre-discussion reports and position papers will not be accepted late.
Exceptions to the deadline policies may (very rarely) be made at
Professor McDaniel's discretion, but only when there are extenuating
circumstances such as a personal emergency or an illness requiring
professional medical attention. These circumstances must be documented
to my satisfaction and, when possible, brought to my attention before
the deadline for a paper arrives.

You are also advised to start assignments early so that if an issue
arises which cannot be documented to my satisfaction but which still
prevents you from finishing on time, you will still have at least some
work to turn in by the deadline and thus avoid receiving no credit at
all.

#### Honor Code

Plagiarism and intellectual dishonesty are violations of the Rice Honor
Code and will be reported to the Honor Council. [Plagiarism is defined
by the Honor Council][] as "quoting, paraphrasing, or otherwise using
another's words or ideas as one's own without properly crediting the
source. ... The Honor Council assumes that, unless otherwise credited,
all work submitted by the student is intended to be considered as his or
her own work. Any time a student draws particularly or generally from
another's work, the source should be properly credited."

#### Disability Services

If you have a documented disability that will impact your work in this
class, please contact Professor McDaniel to discuss accommodations
confidentially. You will also need to contact and register with the
[Disability Support Services Office][] in the Allen Center.
