## Course Description

Each semester, students in HIST 423 read scholarship about a particular
group of American radicals and then conduct independent research on a
historical question related to course themes. In the Fall 2014 semester,
we will be focusing on Americans who formed utopian communities in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

American utopians were visionary people who believed they could change
the world by living in particular kinds of small communities. For some
utopians, these communities were means to other ends, instruments in a
larger movement of social reform. For others, communities were ends in
themselves, designed as radically different alternatives to mainstream
society.

In this course, we will meet figures like John Humphrey Noyes, who
founded a nineteenth-century religious community where members held
property in common and practiced polygamous "free love" relationships.
We'll visit a group of liberal Southern Baptists in Georgia who founded
an interracial cooperative farm called Koinonia Farm, which served as a
seedbed for the present-day non-profit organization Habitat for
Humanity. And we'll also spend time with various socialists, hippies,
and their heirs.

Throughout, we will not only read the latest historical scholarship
about these radicals but will also conduct independent research
projects. In the process we will also consider general scholarly debates
about American reform and radicalism and explore the methods that
historians use to explain past movements, understand their aims, and
gauge their effects on society at large. Among the questions we will
consider are these: How is historical knowledge made? If the past is
past, why are historical interpretations still so contested? What makes
one historical interpretation better than another? How are
interpretations of radicalism in the past shaped by the times in which
historians themselves write?

## Assignments

Your assignments this semester include the following.

-   A 15- to 25-page original research paper, including shorter
    "benchmark" assignments (50% of course grade)
-   A "Wikipedia" entry or revised entry on the topic of your research
    (10%)
-   Weekly short comments on assigned readings (25%)
-   Contributions to seminar discussions (15%)

### Research Project (50% of course grade)

Your major assignment for this course is to write an original,
thesis-driven research paper on some question related to the course
theme. The paper can either be an original work of history that uses
primary and secondary sources to answer some question about a particular
utopian community, or it can be a historiographical paper that uses
scholarly sources to analyze, trace changes in, and explain the way past
historians have understood a particular aspect of utopian communities.
We will talk much more about these possibilities in class, but either
way, **you must advance an original argument that adds something new to
the historical literature on your topic**.

Your final paper should be 15-25 typed, double-spaced pages (including
footnotes).

Because of the length and complexity of this assignment, **this is a
writing-intensive course that will require substantial investments of
your time outside of class**. I will be available throughout the
semester, both in and out of class, to help you succeed. Your fellow
classmates will also work as peer reviewers to assist you in refining
your project and completing your final paper.

In order to complete this assignment, you will:

-   Identify a topic for research
-   Locate primary and secondary sources related to your topic
-   Devise a narrower research question
-   Develop an original thesis that addresses that question
-   Write a paper that defends that thesis and relates it to some
    existing scholarship on your topic

A great deal of class time will be spent explaining in detail how to
complete these steps, and much more information will be distributed on
the blog or in class. You will also be required to complete a variety of
smaller, "benchmark" assignments that will help you prepare for the
final paper. These "benchmark" assignments include:

-   An informal email to me by **September 26** discussing your
    interests or possible ideas for the research paper
-   "Two Topics" Memo: a short, one-page list of two potential research
    topics, along with at least two primary sources and two secondary
    sources you have identified on each topic (due in my email inbox by
    *noon* on **October 1**)
-   Proposal: a two- to three-page proposal explaining your topic, the
    question you want to answer about your topic, and the sources you
    intend to use (due in my email inbox before 11:59 PM on Tuesday,
    **October 22**)
-   Outline of your paper due by *noon* on **October 29**
-   "Primary Source" Memo, a short summary of one significant source
    document you have found for your research, to be shared with the
    seminar on **November 5**
-   Two "Three to Seven Page" Memos (rough drafts of three to seven
    pages from your paper), due by *noon* on **November 12** and
    **November 19**
-   Complete First Draft, due by *noon* on **November 26**; you will
    distribute the draft both to me and to a peer reviewer in the course
    whom I will designate, and we will meet with you during the final
    week of classes to discuss your draft and suggest revisions

Completion of the smaller "memo" and draft assignments are designed to
help you perform well on the final paper and ease your anxiety about the
final product. Moreover, since part of the objective of this seminar is
to introduce you to the tasks of working historians, it's imperative to
know that drafting, outlining, planning, and getting feedback are
essential parts of what historians do.

These "benchmark assignments" will not receive individual grades,
because the point of them is for you to get regular, informal feedback
from me and your classmates before handing in the final paper.
Nonetheless, they are required assignments, and failure to complete them
by the stated deadlines will make it very difficult for you to produce
an "A" final paper. On days when we will be discussing student work in
class, you will be asked to leave if you do not have material to
present. Unless you have a medical emergency, I will not accept these
benchmark assignments late, so failure to meet the deadline also means
you won't get *any* feedback from me on that assignment. I should be
notified about any medical emergencies or potential setbacks to
completing work on time as soon as they arise.

The Final Draft of your paper is due in my email inbox by **5 p.m. on
December 17**. I will distribute a grading rubric beforehand that will
explain exactly how I will assess your final paper. You will be able to
see this rubric long before turning in the paper, and it should help
guide revisions of your drafts along the way.

### Wikipedia Entry or Revision (10% of course grade)

As part of the process of developing your research paper topic, you will
be writing and/or revising a Wikipedia entry about the community or
figure that you choose to study. More information about this assignment,
which will be due on **October 15**, will be distributed in class.

### Blog Comments on Assigned Readings (25% of course grade)

In addition to being a writing intensive course, this is a reading
intensive course, especially in the first half of the semester. Whenever
there are assigned readings, I will post some reading questions on the
home page of the course blog. By noon on the day of our meeting, you
should post a comment in response to one of these questions on the blog.
While you must answer one of the questions, you can also use your
comment to raise other questions of interest to you about the readings
or respond to another student's comment. Days when you can expect to
have comments due are indicated on the schedule below.

I will give you some feedback on your comments after our October 1
meeting, including a rough grade of your comments to date. This will
give you some indication of how you are doing in the comments, but only
your final grade on the reading comments will count towards your grade.
Here is a rough breakdown of what grades for blog posts look like:

-   An "A" on this assignment means that you posted all comments on
    time, and your comments were consistently accurate, thoughtful,
    based on specific evidence and examples drawn from the reading, and
    written in direct answer to one of the questions I posed.
-   A "B" means your comments were mostly accurate but insufficiently
    supported with evidence and examples or not always relevant to the
    questions at hand. You may have failed to post one comment, but
    posted all the others.
-   A "C" means you posted the comment but give little evidence of
    thoughtful engagement with the reading--as evidenced either by
    widespread inaccuracy, very limited use of the texts, clear
    unfamiliarity with the arguments of the book, or lack of
    comprehension of the readings questions posed. You may also have
    failed to post more than one comment.
-   If you receive a grade less than "C" when I give you an initial
    report after October 1, you need to make an appointment to speak
    with me personally.

Your comment should be about 300 to 500 words, though longer posts are
also acceptable. It should be free of grammatical and typographical
errors. It must be posted by noon on the day of our meeting unless there
is an emergency that you can document to my satisfaction; late comments
will not be accepted, and missing comments will lower your grade on this
assignment. You should treat your post with the same seriousness and
attention to detail as you would give to a response paper handed in to
me, while also taking seriously your responsibility to inform and engage
your fellow classmates.

### Seminar Contributions (15% of course grade)

This course will be run as a seminar, which means that your
participation is crucial to its success. That participation should come
mainly in two forms, which will be weighted equally:

First, you should contribute regularly to in-class discussions. Many of
our class periods will be spent discussing assigned texts. That means
you should come prepared to talk about the required readings and should
spend time thinking about any discussion questions that I circulate
beforehand. Whereas in a lecture course you might take most of your
notes in class, in a seminar it's a good idea to take most of your notes
before class so that you will be prepared to contribute to the
discussion. As you read, jot down questions about the readings,
summarize their major arguments, brainstorm potential problems with the
readings, etc., and then use these notes to assist you in class.

Secondly, you should give feedback to your fellow historians in the
seminar about their research projects. Informally, this means attending
to and commenting on student's projects whenever we discuss them in
class. Formally, it means that you will at various points be assigned as
a "peer reviewer" for one of your classmates. Towards the end of the
semester, you will exchange complete rough drafts with a partner
designated by me, and you will be responsible for writing a thoughtful,
300-600 word memo to him/her with comments and suggestions about the
draft. You will also be required to meet with me and your peer reviewer
to discuss the draft.

An "A" student will make regular, consistently excellent contributions
to the intellectual community of the course, though the quality of your
contributions is more important than their quantity. You are free to
speak with me throughout the semester about how you are doing in class,
and I encourage you to do so. Your performance in this course is
ultimately your responsibility.

## General Policies

#### Attendance

Since discussion is a crucial part of this course, attendance is
mandatory. Please be aware that **more than two unexcused absences**
will result in a full letter grade deduction from your grade for
"contributions to the seminar" for **each additional absence** since
without your presence in the seminar, I cannot assess your performance
on this assignment. If you miss more than once because of a chronic
medical problem that arises during the course of the semester, you
should contact me confidentially right away. All absences in case of
medical or personal emergency must be documented to my satisfaction.

#### Classroom Civility

I expect everyone to treat other members of this course with respect,
just as you have the right to expect the same from me. As part of that
respect, please refrain from distracting activities during class, which
include interrupting your classmates during discussion, or using cell
phones or laptop computers for personal instead of course-related
business.

#### Honor Code

The Honor Code covers all work performed in this class, and all
suspected cases of plagiarism and intellectual dishonesty will be
reported to the Honor Council. If you are unclear at any time about what
constitutes an Honor Code violation in this course, it is your
responsibility to clarify the issue with me before any ambiguous case
arises. Please take the time to read the Honor Council's explanation of
what constitutes plagiarism and intellectual dishonesty; don't assume
you know the definitions of those terms until you read [the Honor System
Handbook][] carefully.
